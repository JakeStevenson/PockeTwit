#summary Download the latest unstable development build.

= Introduction =

This is a link to the latest unstable development testing build.  I use it to test out code before I feel it's ready for release to general users.  It usually runs ok, but is much more likely to have bugs or crash than a "release" version.

Installing it will not overwrite or affect an installed "release" build.  It creates its own separate folder and shortcut.

There is no upgrade checker built into the dev build.  However you can always get the latest build by going to the "About" page and choosing "Upgrade".
