#summary PockeTwit notification system.

= Introduction =

PockeTwit uses standard Windows Mobile notifications to inform you of new messages and/or new friend status updates.


= Details =

On PocketPC devices, PockeTwit uses the standard notification system to inform the user of changes.  To access these settings, choose "Settings" from the Windows Mobile Start Menu, then click the "Sounds & Notifications" icon, then the "Notifications" tab.

PockeTwit can raise two kinds of notifications:
 * PockeTwit: Friends Updates
 * PockaTwit: Messages

This allows you to have different settings for messages sent to you versus regular updates.

*PLEASE NOTE:*  These settings are erased every time PockeTwit is uninstalled and re-installed.  You will have to re-configure them on every upgrade.  I am working to find a way around this issue.
